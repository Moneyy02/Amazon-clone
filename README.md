# Amazon-clone
This project is a simple, static Amazon clone built using only HTML and CSS. It mimics the layout and design of Amazon's homepage but without any dynamic functionality. This clone serves as a basic template showcasing how to structure an e-commerce webpage using only frontend technologies.
